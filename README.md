In-Depth-Fractional-RothC is a C++ code for implementig the fractional in depth version of the RothC model for simaluting the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) in costal wetlands.

The implementation of this code was carried out within the framework of the project HORIZON RESTORE4Cs "Modelling RESTORation of wEtlands for Carbon pathways, Climate Change mitigation and adaptation, ecosystem services, and biodiversity, Co-benefits", Grant Agreement No. 101056782 and within the  project funded under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), Mission 4 Component 2 Investment 1.4 - Call for tender No. 3138 of 16 December 2021, rectified by Decree n.3175 of 18 December 2021 of Italian Ministry of University and Research funded by the European Union – NextGenerationEU; Award Number: Project code CN 00000033, Concession Decree No. 1034 of 17 June 2022 adopted by the Italian Ministry of University and Research, CUP B83C22002930006, Project title “National Biodiversity Future Center - NBFC".

The routine can be used under the conditions of CC-BY-NC 2.0.
